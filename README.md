# REFSA living wage comparison calculator

This is a single-page tool to compare a given income to the living wage in each state of Malaysia (taking into account household type and urban/rural location.) The calculation of the living wage is set out in the REFSA Brief "[Uncovering the plight of low-income Malaysia](https://refsa.org/uncovering-the-plight-of-lower-income-malaysia/)."

The page uses simple Javascript to compute the difference between the wage entered and the living wage, and also used D3 to show a map of Malaysia, colour-coded for each state, showing how far the wage entered and the living wage for that state is.
